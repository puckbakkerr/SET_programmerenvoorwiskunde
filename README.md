# SET_programmerenvoorwiskunde
##Puck Bakker en Luka Klooster


Project Description:

We started with the assignment; write a game of SET that you can play against the computer. The main components of our game are:
- If the player recognizes a set, the player should get a point and the cards should be replenished. 
- If the player does not find a set in a given time limit, the computer should find one. If one is found, the computer gets a point. Else, if there is no set on the table, the first three cards are replaced by new ones.
- The first one to reach 5 points is the winner.

We chose to add a few elements to that; choose your time limit, compete with the computer using a scoreboard, have a winner, let the player click on the cards, deselect the cards after the computer gets a set, and being able to restart the game without restarting the program.


Installation Instructions:

Before running our program, you need to install pygame. You can do that by typing into your terminal: pip install pygame.
After pygame is succesfully installed, you can run the program and a screen will open. 


Usage:

You can use this program to - of course - play SET. You can also use some of our code to improve your own project. We used comments to make sure you know what function takes care of what part of the program.
