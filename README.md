##Puck Bakker en Luka Klooster


Project Description:

We started with the assignment; write a game of SET that you can play against the computer In our variant are there a few rules. 
- There are always twelve cards on the table. The player who recognizes a set first will get the points. Those cards will be removed, and the cards will be replenished to twelve. 
- If there isnâ€™t a set found after thirty seconds, the top three cards are removed, and three new cards are added. 
We chose to add a few elements to that; choose your time limit, compete with the computer using a scoreboard, choose a winner, let the player click on the cards, deselect the cards after the computer gets a set, and being able to restart the game without restarting the program.

A brief description or overview of the project, explaining its purpose and main features.
